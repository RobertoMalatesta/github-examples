# Docker Build and Push

This example demonstrates how you can use docker to build and push an image to Docker Hub.

To enable this as a GitHub action you will have to do the following:

1. Copy the contents of the docker-snapshot.yml into a new or existing workflow
2. Adjust the image name
3. Add the DOCKER_USERNAME secret as a secret to your GitHub account / organization
4. Add the DOCKER_PASSWORD secret as a secret to your GitHub account / organization
